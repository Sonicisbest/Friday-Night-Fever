:deprisoner: I’ve been in this ridiculous outfit for over a month.
:deprisoner: I can hardly understand a lick of what you guys are saying.
:deprisoner: And everytime I think about escaping, the chains around my wrists send a very painful electric shock.
:deprisoner: This one guard won't stop looking at me either.
:deprisoner: Stop talking to me, or I’m going to try attacking the next person you bunk me with.
:NPC: Bahaha!
:NPC: You of all people should already know that doing that will send you straight to sleep.
:NPC: Those handcuffs of yours are ready to administer a very strong sedative if you so much as think about it!
:NPC: We wouldn’t want you to get hurt. That’ll look bad on the news.
:NPC: Speaking of the news, tomorrow’s your trial. And I gotta say, it’ll be interesting.
:NPC: We’ve never had a trial where we don’t know the NAME of the defendant! Honestly, I thought we’d torture that out of you quickly.
:NPC: You demons are a nasty folk, aren’t you?
:deprisoner: ...
:NPC: I hurt your feelings didn’t I? Don’t worry, I'm sure what they'll do to you will make me seem like a joke.

:teasmile: Hey, wake up.
:feverscaredjump: Huh? What?-
:teasmile: You were having a nightmare. Something like that, at least.
:feverconfuse: Oh.
:fevertired: Thanks for waking me up.
:fevertired: Where was I?
:teasmile: We were heading to bed?
:feversmile : No no, I should finish this work. Keeping this shit piled up will annoy me.
:teaannoy: So you can drool on those papers some more?
:feverworry: Uh, no…
:teasmile: Ugh.
:teasmile: There’s no need to rush things, you know.
:fevertired: Yeah, yeah, I know. I wish I could sleep without jolting awake a few minutes in.
:teathink: I still wish you’d tell me more.
:fevertired: I will, soon. Sorry, it’s just annoying.
:teaneutral: Well, I can think of a way we can help you relax.
:fuckoff:
:feversilly: Oh yeah? Sure.
